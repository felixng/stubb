            Stubbed is a theatre diary: you log the shows you see, rate them and
            share them. This policy explains what personal data we collect, why,
            who we share it with, how long we keep it, and the rights you have
            wherever you live, including in the UK, the European Union and the
            United States.
          </p>
          <p>
            The short version: we collect only what the app needs to work, we
            never sell your data or use it for advertising, and you can ask us
            for a copy of it or to delete it at any time.

          Legal basis: performing our contract with you. Please don’t put

        </p>

        <SubHeading>Photos and show detection</SubHeading>
        <p>
          When you add a photo to an entry, your browser reads the date, time and
          location the photo was taken from its metadata (EXIF), then makes a
          resized copy with all metadata removed. Only that clean copy is
          uploaded. The original photo never leaves your device, and we never
          store the photo’s location.
        </p>
        <p>To suggest the show and venue for you, we may also:</p>
        <List>
          <li>
            send the photo’s location to OpenStreetMap services to look up
            nearby theatres and the city. This is sent from our servers without
            your name, email or any account identifier;
          </li>
          <li>
            send the clean copy of the photo, its date and time, an approximate
            location (rounded to about 100 metres) and the nearby theatres to
            an AI provider (see{" "}
            <TextLink href="#sharing">who we share data with</TextLink>), which
            may search the web to identify the show.
          </li>
        </List>
        <p>
          Suggestions are only suggestions: nothing is saved until you confirm
          it, and you can always fill in an entry by hand without a photo.
          Legal basis: performing our contract with you, as this is a feature
          you choose to use. We don’t make any decisions about you by
          automated means that have legal or similarly significant effects.
        </p>

        <SubHeading>Importing ticket emails</SubHeading>
        <p>
          If you import booking confirmation emails, your browser opens the
          email files and sends only their readable text (subject, sender, date
          and body) to our servers, where an AI provider reads out the show,
          venue, date, time, seats and price. Booking emails can contain other
          details, such as your name, address or an order number; we don’t
          look for or keep them. The email text isn’t stored or logged: you get
          draft entries to review, and only what you confirm is saved. Legal
          basis: performing our contract with you, as this is a feature you
          choose to use.

        <SubHeading>Technical data</SubHeading>
        <p>
          Like any website, our hosting and database providers log technical
          details of each request, such as your IP address, browser type and the
          pages you visit, to keep the service running and secure. Legal basis:
          our legitimate interest in operating a secure service.

          Your handle, display name, avatar, bio and link are public, on your
          profile page at /@yourhandle. The page also shows your public entries
          and their photos, plus stats and a calendar based only on public
          entries. Make your profile private in your settings and only you can
          see your entries, trips, photos and stats; your handle, name, avatar,
          bio and link stay visible. Otherwise, entries and trips
          are <strong>public by default</strong>: anyone, including people
          without an account and search engines, can see them, along with any
          photo attached. You can make any entry or trip private, or change your
          default to private, at any time. Private entries are visible only to
          you.

        <p>
          If you share a card or a link, the people and services you share it
          with (for example Instagram or WhatsApp) can see and keep what you
          shared, under their own privacy policies.
