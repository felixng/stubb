// Admins are marked in Supabase Auth, not in our tables: `app_metadata.role`
// is "admin". Only the service role can write app_metadata (set it in the
// Supabase dashboard or SQL, see docs/DECISIONS.md), and it rides in the
// signed session token, so checking it needs no extra query. A user can't
// set it themselves: user_metadata is theirs to edit, app_metadata isn't.
//
// Being an admin only unlocks the admin pages under /app/admin and the
// testing options their routes accept. Everywhere else an admin sees exactly
// what any other user sees.
