# Supabase

The shared backend for web and iOS: SQL migrations (tables, constraints, row-level security, functions) and database tests. The schema is the contract between the two apps.

```
config.toml   local stack config (`supabase init`)
migrations/   timestamped SQL migrations
tests/        pgTAP privacy tests
```

There is no seed catalogue: shows and venues are added through the app and by imports. Use `search_shows(q)` and `search_venues(q, near_lat, near_lng)` to find an existing row before creating one.

## Local

Requires Docker and the Supabase CLI (`npx supabase ...` works).

```bash
npx supabase start        # local stack; applies migrations
npx supabase db reset     # re-apply migrations from scratch
npx supabase test db      # run tests/ (also runs in CI)
```

## Schema v1 (#12)

| Table | Read | Write |
|-------|------|-------|
| `profiles` | Everyone (anon: handle, display name, avatar only) | Own row; created by a trigger on sign-up |
| `shows`, `venues` | Everyone | Signed-in users add; creators edit their own unverified rows; `verified` is set from the dashboard |
| `entries`, `collections` | Everyone if `visibility = 'public'`; owner always | Owner only |
| `entry_collections` | Everyone if both ends are public; owner always | Owner, linking own entries to own collections |

New entries and collections take `visibility` from `profiles.default_visibility` (default `public`) unless given.

## Auth (#13)

Owner-only sign-in with **Google** or **email + password**. Sign-ups are off (`enable_signup = false` here and in the hosted project), so both only sign in existing users. Google gets in when the Google account's email matches an existing user (Supabase links the identity automatically).

Hosted project, once:

1. **Owner user:** Authentication → Users → Add user → Create new user, with your email, a password and "Auto confirm user" ticked. If you already invited yourself, set a password from the same screen instead.
2. **Sign-ups off:** Authentication → Sign In / Providers → "Allow new users to sign up" off.
3. **Google:**
   - In Google Cloud Console (free): APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen (External; add your email as a test user, or publish it, since basic scopes need no review), then Credentials → Create OAuth client ID → Web application.
   - Authorised redirect URI: `https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`.
   - In Supabase: Authentication → Sign In / Providers → Google: enable it, paste the client ID and secret.
4. **Redirect URLs:** Authentication → URL Configuration: Site URL = the production URL; add `https://<production-domain>/auth/callback` (and `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` for local dev against the hosted project) to Redirect URLs.

Locally, use email + password: add a user in Studio (http://127.0.0.1:54323). Google isn't configured in the local stack.
