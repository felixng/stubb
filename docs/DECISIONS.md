## Log

### 2026-10-12: Project brief lives in `CLAUDE.md`
Saved the brief as `CLAUDE.md` so every Claude Code session loads it automatically. Phases are tracked as GitHub epic issues.

### 2026-10-12: Web validation build this week, iOS app in about a month, $0/month
The owner wants a quick web version to validate this week, then an iOS app sharing the same users and data, on free tiers only. This brings iOS forward from "Later". Proposed design: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Both clients talk directly to Supabase, with rules enforced by Postgres RLS. Vercel hosts only server-needing routes (share cards, public OG pages). No custom API server.

### 2026-10-12: Entries default to public
Owner's call, "for now". It maximises shareable content and supports the share-card acquisition loop. Safeguards: the visibility state is shown on the log form with a one-tap per-entry toggle; users can change their default to private in settings; RLS tests cover both states. Revisit if early users find it surprising.

### 2026-10-12: iOS app is native SwiftUI
Owner prefers native SwiftUI over Expo/React Native. Consequence: no shared client code, so logic both apps need (validation, stats, search) lives in Postgres (constraints, RLS, SQL functions). The schema is the contract; Swift types are generated with `supabase gen types --lang swift`. Repo layout: see the monorepo entry below.

### 2026-10-12: This week is "NYC week"
The owner has ~3–4 sessions of 2 hours this week. Focus: (1) a great public landing page with mockups and a waitlist, (2) an owner-only hidden login to log their NYC shows (manual, from ticket emails, or from photos), group them into a trip, and share an excellent Instagram card at the end of the week. Public sign-up is off. This pulls email/photo import and the trip recap card forward from Phase 2, in a minimal owner-only form. Tracked in the NYC week epic.

### 2026-10-12: Name, Claude API and NYC-week dependencies approved
- Product name: **Stubbed**.
- The Claude API is approved for email/photo import (paid, small; spend limit set in the Anthropic console).
- Approved dependencies for NYC week: Tailwind CSS, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `@supabase/ssr`, `exifr`, Anthropic SDK (plus Next.js/React/TypeScript tooling). Anything beyond this list still needs a check.
- The NYC show list will come from the owner once the web app is ready. Seed data covers venues plus a few long-running shows; other shows get added through the app.

### 2026-10-12: Monorepo with pnpm workspaces
The owner wants the iOS app, the web app and the landing page in this one repo. Layout: `apps/web` (Next.js: landing at `/`, owner app at `/app`, share cards), `apps/ios` (SwiftUI, later), `supabase/` (the shared backend), `packages/` (only if shared JS is ever needed). pnpm workspaces only, no Turborepo/Nx. The landing page is part of the web app, not a separate app, so it shares the domain, design tokens and the share-card route. Vercel root directory: `apps/web`.

### 2026-10-12: Any theatre, no city limit; US/UK focus is internal only
The owner dropped the London/NYC/Edinburgh launch scope: the product covers any theatre, anywhere. Early effort (seed catalogue, marketing) still focuses on the US and UK, but users aren't told this. Public copy doesn't mention launch cities or regions, and the waitlist doesn't ask for a city.

### 2026-10-12: Design system "Interval"
The owner's design system artifact (https://claude.ai/artifact/UZXAQQuAaRmwtUDhYPE36U) replaces the earlier cream/curtain-red/Fraunces palette. It is dark first, with a single lime accent for the one primary action, Bricolage Grotesque + DM Sans, and a 4px spacing scale. Tokens live in `apps/web/src/app/globals.css`, React components in `apps/web/src/components/ui/`, and the mapping in `docs/DESIGN.md`.

### 2026-10-12: No share button on the waitlist success state
The owner dropped the "share with a theatre friend" button from #10. The success state is just the confirmation message. The share card remains the acquisition loop.

### 2026-10-12: Design system "Footlight" (native first)
The owner moved the design system to iOS-native first: "Footlight" (https://claude.ai/artifact/Pw3EwEHyfYxzshKVTFQAzc) replaces "Interval". Tokens are named after the iOS semantic colours, type is the system font (SF Pro) instead of Google Fonts, buttons and chips are capsules, and the page follows the visitor's light/dark setting instead of being dark-only. The wordmark is now `STUBBED` in capitals. The SwiftUI files in the artifact's `ios.md` are the native counterpart to `apps/web/src/components/ui/`. Mapping: `docs/DESIGN.md`.

### 2026-10-12: Design system "Footlight Coral" and new landing copy
The owner moved Footlight from the lime tint to coral: "Footlight Coral" (https://claude.ai/artifact/2r1EvQn2286Y29ZJNgPfP6) replaces the earlier Footlight artifact. Same token names, plus `tint-text` (brand colour as text, since coral fails contrast as text on light), `glow` (hero halo) and three shadows (`shadow-sm`, `shadow-lg`, `shadow-btn`); light mode sits on a soft peach ground. The landing page follows the owner's "Footlight Coral" landing design (https://claude.ai/artifact/GPberFRRTagnixyiXy3euN): pill-shaped email field, glow halo behind the phone and four feature cards, keeping the existing beta pill, feature chips and footer. The eyebrow reads "For the theatre regulars" (owner's wording).

### 2026-10-12: Schema v1 details (#12)
- `entries.venue_id` is required, like `show_id` and `date`, so stats ("venues visited", cities) stay accurate.
- New entries and collections take `visibility` from the profile default when the client doesn't send one (a trigger), so web and iOS can't drift.
- Clients can't set `verified` on shows or venues (column grants); the owner verifies from the dashboard. Shows have no unique title constraint (*Macbeth* is a play and an opera); `search_shows` is the dedupe step. Venues dedupe on `osm_id`.
- Logged-out visitors read only a profile's handle, display name and avatar. Signed-in users can also read `default_visibility`, since grants are per column; it reveals nothing their public entries don't.
- A trip's entry links are public only when both the entry and the trip are public, so a public trip page never lists private entries.

### 2026-10-12: Wordmark option B (lowercase)
The owner picked option B from the wordmark options board: `stubbed` in lowercase, SF Pro Display heavy (800), tracking -0.045em, in `label`. It replaces the capitals wordmark in both Footlight systems (lime and Coral), the landing and app-screen designs, the web `Wordmark` and `FLWordmark`. The product name in running copy stays "Stubbed", and screen readers hear "Stubbed". No colour or other token changed.

### 2026-10-12: Sign-in is Google + email and password; sign-ups stay off
Owner's call (#13): no magic link or emailed code. The login page offers "Continue with Google" and an email + password form. Sign-ups remain off during NYC week, so both only sign in accounts created in the Supabase dashboard; Google signs into the account whose email matches. Not depending on login emails also sidesteps Supabase's built-in sender limit of a few emails an hour. Apple sign-in is still needed before the iOS app ships (App Store rule 4.8). Password reset by email comes with public sign-up.

### 2026-10-12: Logging is photo first (#14)
Owner's call. The log form starts with a photo and fills in what it can: the date from the photo's EXIF, nearby theatres from its GPS (OpenStreetMap), and the show and venue from Claude (photo + nearby theatres + date, with web search). Anything it can't work out stays blank for the user. High or medium confidence fills empty fields; low confidence only shows a "Maybe X?" chip. Detection never overwrites a field the user has touched. With no date in the photo, the date defaults to today. "No photo? Fill in by hand" skips straight to the form. This pulls the single-photo part of #18 into #14; #18 keeps batch import of several photos, reusing the same routes.
- The original photo never leaves the phone: it's re-encoded to JPEG on the device (no EXIF/GPS), then uploaded to the private `entry-photos` bucket. Others can read a photo only while its entry is public.
- Claude calls go through `/api/photo/identify` (`claude-opus-5-5`, effort medium, web search up to 3 uses, server-side refusal fallback on). Until `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set it returns 503 and the form simply skips the suggestion.

### 2026-10-13: App and sign-in are always light; landing menu links to sign-in
Owner's call: `/app` and `/login` now stay light whatever the device setting, like the landing page (`data-theme="light"`). Dark mode can come back later; the tokens are unchanged. The landing page gets a hamburger menu next to the beta pill whose only item is "Sign in", so the login page is no longer unlinked. Sign-ups stay off, so the link reveals nothing.

### 2026-10-13: AI calls go through `lib/ai`, Groq first
Owner's call. All model calls go through `apps/web/src/lib/ai`: a feature sends a provider-neutral request (system prompt, text/image parts, JSON Schema, optional web search) and gets back the first acceptable answer from an ordered chain of models. Providers live side by side (`groq.ts`, `anthropic.ts`); adding one is a new file plus an entry in the registry.
- Default chain: Groq (`meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`, vision + JSON Schema) then Claude (`claude-opus-5-5` with web search). Called with `fetch`, so Groq adds no dependency.
- Swap or reorder models with `AI_MODELS` or a per-task `AI_MODELS_<TASK>` (e.g. `AI_MODELS_IDENTIFY="anthropic,groq"`); providers without a key are skipped.
- A model that errors, declines, or isn't accepted by the feature hands over to the next. Photo identify only accepts a named show at medium or high confidence, since Groq's vision models can't search the web; otherwise Claude gets a go. The whole chain shares one time budget so the fallback fits in the route's limit.
- Gemini and Cerebras added as optional providers (fetch only, no SDK), not in the default chain; name them in `AI_MODELS` to try them. Gemini (`gemini-flash-latest`) takes images and uses Google Search grounding. Cerebras (`gpt-oss-120b`) is text only, so requests with images skip it; it's meant for text tasks like pasted ticket emails.

### 2026-10-13: Bulk import tool, testing version (#17, #18)
Owner's call: one import screen (`/app/import`) for both sources, built for desktop testing first, on shared logic that a mobile-first import can reuse.
- **Emails:** upload exported files (.eml, .mbox, saved .html, .txt) or paste one. MIME is decoded on the device (`lib/import/email-parse.ts`); only the readable text goes to `/api/import/email`, one email per call, a few at a time. Attachments are never sent. The email text isn't stored or logged (token counts only). Extraction goes through `lib/ai` like photo detection (task `email`, low effort, no web search), so `AI_MODELS_EMAIL` picks its chain.
- **Photos:** several at once. Each runs through the #14 pipeline, now shared in `lib/import/photo-pipeline.ts`. Photos from the same visit (same date, within 5 hours, within 250 m) become one draft and one identify call with up to 4 photos (`/api/photo/identify` now accepts several).
- **Review:** every source is listed with what was read from it. Each show becomes a draft with the read values, confidence and reason, and editable show, venue, date, rating and note. Same rule as the log form: low confidence never fills a field, it offers "Maybe X?". A booking and its reminder merge into one draft. Drafts matching an entry already in the diary are flagged. Nothing is saved until "Save"; entries take the profile's default visibility, and can be added to trips and labels in one go.
- Drafts live in page state for now; `import_drafts` comes with the mobile flow if needed.
- Unit tests use Node's built-in test runner (`pnpm test`, also in CI), so no new dependency. They cover email parsing, photo grouping, draft merging and the extraction mapping, with synthetic fixtures. Redacted real confirmation emails can be added under `apps/web/test/fixtures/emails/`.
- **Choosing the AI provider:** the import screen has a model picker (owner testing). The default, **Compare all providers**, sends each email or photo visit to every provider with an API key at once (photos skip text-only ones) and shows the answers side by side with timings and the fields they disagree on. Drafts come from the best answer (confident first, then the default chain's order), and "Use this" switches a source's drafts to another provider's answer. It costs one call per provider per source. The other options: the default chain with fallback, or one provider (optionally a model id) with no fallback. Each source and draft shows which model read it. The choice is remembered in the browser.

### 2026-10-13: Groq and Cerebras pick their default model from what they serve
Found in the owner's first real import: Groq's default (Llama 4 Scout, shut down 17 July 2026) and Cerebras's new default (Gemma 4 31B, off the shared API since 3 September 2026) both returned "model not found". Providers retire models every few months, so a hardcoded default goes stale. Groq and Cerebras now keep a short preference list (Groq: `qwen/qwen3.8-27b`, then `qwen/qwen3.6-27b`; Cerebras: `qwen-3.8-27b`, all vision models) and use the first one their `/models` endpoint lists for the key, checked every 10 minutes; if the list can't be read, the first preference is used. A model named explicitly (`groq:…`) is used as is. The import tool's picker suggests model ids from those lists, and failed calls show the provider's error message. This replaces the Gemma 4 decision and the Groq model named in the `lib/ai` entry. Gemini's 429 in the same run was the key's quota, not code; at the owner's request Gemini now defaults to `gemini-3.8-flash`, which their free-tier key can use.

### 2026-10-13: Compare mode runs several Claude models side by side
Owner's call, to see how fast and accurate each Claude model is. In the import tool's compare mode Claude gets one column per model: Opus 5.5, Sonnet 5.5, Haiku 5.5 and Fable 5.1 (the list is `COMPARE_MODELS` in `lib/ai/anthropic.ts`). Every column gets the identical request (same prompt, photos, effort and web search) and shows its own round-trip time. Haiku 5.5 has no server-side refusal fallback and takes the basic web search tool, so its requests leave the fallback out and use `web_search_20250305`; the others are unchanged. Cost: a photo visit is now up to 7 calls, Fable being the priciest; the email route's per-user limit goes to 1,000 calls per 10 minutes.

### 2026-10-13: Photo identify works from venue and date first; compare Opus and Haiku only
Owner's call. The identify prompt now follows the owner's order: (1) take the venue and date (nearby theatres plus the photo's date), (2) search what was playing there that day for a short list of shows, (3) match the photo's set against that list, searching production photos when it helps. (4) A title, programme or Playbill readable in the photo always wins; the venue search then only picks the theatre. The reason starts with what settled it. Providers without web search are told to skip searching, as before. The import tool's compare mode now runs only Opus 5.5 against Haiku 5.5: Sonnet and Fable are dropped, and so are Groq, Gemini and Cerebras (still pickable one at a time, and still in the default chain where configured). Compare mode includes only providers that list `compareModels`.

### 2026-10-13: Faster nearby-theatre lookup; three visits at a time; photo thumbnails
Production logs showed every nearby lookup failing (public Overpass servers timing out or returning 504 from Vercel), costing about 14 seconds per photo visit before identify even started, and leaving Claude with no candidate theatres. Now:
- The Overpass mirrors are asked at once and the first answer wins, with a 4-second limit. Nominatim's theatre search (no key needed, like Overpass) runs alongside as the fallback when every Overpass server fails. Nominatim calls are spaced about a second apart, as its usage policy asks. Results are cached per ~100 m square for the server instance.
- The client checks saved venues near the photo at the same time, so a theatre already in the catalogue is found even when OpenStreetMap is down.
- The import tool runs three photo visits (and three emails) at a time; with only two compared models, that's safe for rate limits.
- Each photo visit in "What we read" shows its photos as thumbnails (tap to open full size), so it's clear which photo the results are about.

### 2026-10-13: The log form never locks; the show arrives as a suggestion
Owner's call, for logging on a trip: replaces "Lock the log form while the photo is checked". Picking a photo fills the date at once and the venue within about a second (one theatre in range fills it; several show as tap-to-pick chips, nearest first). Every field and Save stay usable while the AI works out the show, shown as a small "Working out the show from your photo…" pill. When the answer arrives it fills only fields the user hasn't set: a different show or venue from the user's pick, or a low-confidence guess, appears as a chip ("Photo suggests…", "Maybe…?") and never replaces a choice. Saving first drops the late answer. After 20 seconds the pill gives up quietly ("Couldn't work out the show"). A hard cap on the whole process was rejected: the correct answers that need a web search take 6–17 seconds.

### 2026-10-13: The nearby-theatre radius follows the photo's GPS accuracy
Owner's question after a photo at the National Theatre listed 5 nearby theatres (mostly the NT's own auditoriums). A smaller fixed radius was rejected: indoor photos are often 20–50 m off and Broadway houses can be 30 m apart, so the right theatre would sometimes drop off the list. Instead the radius comes from the accuracy the phone records with the photo (EXIF `GPSHPositioningError`): about 2.5× the stated error, between 60 m and 150 m, and the full 150 m when the photo doesn't say. A group of photos uses its least accurate photo. Precise fixes give shorter lists, and more often a single theatre the log form can fill straight away.

### 2026-10-13: Default AI chain is Claude Opus 5.5, then Claude Haiku 5.5
Owner's call: `DEFAULT_CHAIN` in `lib/ai/index.ts` is now `anthropic:claude-opus-5-5,anthropic:claude-haiku-5-5`; Groq is no longer first and the other providers are out of the default. Haiku runs when Opus errors, declines, or (for photo identify) can't name the show at medium or high confidence. Groq, Gemini and Cerebras keep working when named in `AI_MODELS` or picked on the import screen. No `AI_MODELS` overrides are set in Vercel, so this applies to the log form and the import tool's "Default chain" option.

### 2026-10-13: Admin role; import model comparison is admin-only
Owner's call. An admin is a user whose Supabase Auth `app_metadata.role` is `"admin"`. Only the service role can write `app_metadata` (users can't, unlike `user_metadata`), and it rides in the session token, so the check needs no table or migration. Make an account admin in the Supabase SQL editor, then sign out and in again so the token picks it up:
`update auth.users set raw_app_meta_data = raw_app_meta_data || '{"role":"admin"}' where email = '<owner email>';`
- Admin pages live under `/app/admin` (index: `/app/admin`; model comparison: `/app/admin/import`). Non-admins get a 404 there, from the proxy and again from the page itself.
- Everywhere else an admin sees exactly what any user sees, so the owner can test the real flow. Nothing outside `/app/admin` links to it; open it by URL.
- `/app/import` stays for everyone, without the model picker or comparison: it uses the default AI chain, like the log form.
- Server side, `/api/ai/providers` and the `model` option on `/api/import/email` and `/api/photo/identify` are admin-only (403 otherwise).

### 2026-10-13: Share cards are drawn on the phone; sharing opens after logging
Owner's call: sharing should feel like Hevy. Saving a new entry now opens a share screen (`/app/entries/[id]/share`) with a swipeable carousel of card designs and three actions: **Stories** (the share sheet with only the image, where Instagram offers Stories), **More** (the share sheet with the image and a line of text) and **Download**. Entries also get a Share button. On browsers that can't share files (most desktops), Stories and More save the image instead. A web page can't post straight to an Instagram story; only native apps can, so the iOS app can add a direct button later.
- Three designs to start, from the owner's "Share cards" canvas (https://claude.ai/artifact/JBrH9jzd4ke4YtpRLQWhPC): "Square · single, full photo", "Hevy-style · photo" (show of the year, Nth visit to the venue, rating) and "Hevy-style · photo, seen before" (times seen instead of venue visits). 1080×1080 PNG with rounded corners.
- Cards are drawn in the browser with Canvas 2D (`apps/web/src/lib/share-card.ts`), not by a server route as `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` suggested. The system font (SF Pro on iPhone) matches Footlight, the private photo never goes to a server, it costs nothing and needs no new dependency. A server-rendered card is still needed later for Open Graph previews on public entry pages.
- Stats count the owner's entries up to and including this one (by date, then by when logged), so an old entry's card shows what was true then. No rating drops the rating column; no photo uses a dark ground with a coral glow.
- Follow-up from more Hevy screenshots: one full-width card at a time (no peeking), a **Background** toggle that drops the photo and shading for a transparent PNG with shadowed text (to lay over your own story photo; the preview shows a checkerboard), a sideways-scrolling action row and **Copy text**. Hevy's "Workout link" equivalent waits for public entry pages; no X/Twitter button for now.

### 2026-10-13: Landing page SEO basics
The landing page gets a canonical URL, full Open Graph/X tags with a generated 1200×630 preview image (`opengraph-image.tsx`), `WebSite` structured data, a sitemap, and a `Sitemap:` line in `robots.txt`. The public origin comes from `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, falling back to Vercel's production domain. `/login` is no longer disallowed in `robots.txt`: it's linked from the landing menu, and crawlers must fetch it to see its `noindex`. The preview image uses the regular-weight Geist that ships with `next/og`; a heavy font file would match the wordmark better.

### 2026-10-13: Stubbed's Instagram account is @stubbedapp
Owner's info. The share screen's caption reads "Share your show · Tag @stubbedapp" (like Hevy's "Tag @hevyapp"), and the copied/shared text ends "Logged on Stubbed @stubbedapp". The handle is not drawn on the cards themselves; they carry the `stubbed` wordmark and the user's handle.

### 2026-10-13: Public profile at /@handle
Modelled on Hevy's profile (owner's screenshots). `/@handle` (rewritten to `app/u/[handle]`) shows a cover strip of up to five recent public photos, avatar, handle and display name, three stats (shows, theatres, cities), a month calendar, and public entries as cards, newest first.
- **Opt-in is the handle** (owner's call): a profile is live once a handle is set in `/app/profile` and off when it's cleared. No separate switch. *Superseded below by "Private profiles, Hevy style".*
- **Public entries only, for everyone**, including the owner looking at their own page. The page reads with the publishable key and no session (`createPublicClient`), so RLS can't return private rows. Stats come from `public_profile_stats(profile_id)` in Postgres, so iOS gets the same numbers.
- **Month calendar** (owner's go-ahead for this slice of the "theatregoing calendar" idea): one month at a time, Monday first, show days filled in coral and linked to their entry. It opens on the month of the latest show, since most months have none. Granularity toggles and heatmap shading are still undecided.
- Rendered per request, not cached, so an entry made private disappears straight away. Its own `og:image` waits for the server-rendered card (share cards above are drawn on the phone); until then it inherits the site's.

### 2026-10-13: Landing page content for search and AI answers (GEO)
The landing page was too thin for search engines or AI assistants to describe (171 words, one heading level). Added, all worded for the private beta (no open sign-up, no prices, no dates):
- A "What is Stubbed?" section in plain, quotable sentences, a visible "What you can do" heading over the feature cards (now h3, plus "Bring your history" and "Public or private"), and a "Questions" FAQ. The FAQ list (`components/landing/Faq.tsx`) also feeds `FAQPage` structured data and `/llms.txt`, so they can't drift.
- Structured data is now a graph: `WebSite`, `Organization`, `WebApplication` (no offers, since sign-ups aren't open) and `FAQPage`. Add `sameAs` links to `Organization` once there are social accounts.
- Title 56 characters, description 158, the hero phone image has alt text.
- The page is ~650 words. An audit tool asked for 800; padding a landing page reads worse to people and AI, so it stops there.
- FAQ commitments to check: "logging your shows and getting your own data out will always be free" (from the ground rules in `docs/MONETISATION.md`), CSV export ("you'll be able to"), and "a native iPhone app is planned".

### 2026-10-13: Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
Added `/terms` and `/privacy`, linked from the footer, plus a privacy link under the waitlist form. Written to cover the UK (UK GDPR, DPA 2018, PECR, Consumer Rights Act, Online Safety Act), the EU (GDPR, consumer law, DSA notice and action) and the US (CCPA/CPRA and other state laws, CalOPPA, COPPA, DMCA notice). Choices: minimum age 16 everywhere (simplest age that works for GDPR consent across the EU and keeps clear of COPPA); governing law England and Wales, with consumers keeping their local mandatory protections and courts; essential cookies only, so no cookie banner. Contact email is support@getstubbed.app. The owner's call: leave out the operator's legal name and postal address for the private beta; UK/EU GDPR and the UK E-Commerce Regulations expect both, so add them to `apps/web/src/lib/legal.ts` before public launch (the pages show them once set). Not legal advice: have a lawyer review before public launch. Update the policy in the same change whenever a feature starts collecting or sharing something new.

### 2026-10-13: The entry page is the share screen
Owner's call: sharing is first class. The separate `/app/entries/[id]/share` page is gone; the entry page (`/app/entries/[id]`, where logging lands with "Logged. Share it?") opens with the card carousel and action row. **Edit** is now one of the actions in that row, after Copy text. Below the actions: the entry's type, full date, note, trips and visibility, then Delete. Replaces the "Share button on the entry page" part of "Share cards are drawn on the phone".

### 2026-10-13: Profile onboarding at /welcome
Owner's call: a signed-in user with no handle is sent to `/welcome` before any `/app` page, to set their name (required), handle (required), a bio (optional, ≤ 160 characters) and one link (optional, e.g. Instagram; `https://` is added to a bare `instagram.com/you`). `profiles` gains public `bio` and `link` columns (migration `20261013130000_profile_onboarding.sql`); the link must be an http(s) URL in Postgres too, so it is safe to render as a link later. The proxy does the check; once a handle exists it remembers that in an `httpOnly` cookie holding the user id, so later navigations skip the profile lookup. The handle field checks availability as it's typed, and the save still catches a clash. No reserved-handle list yet.

### 2026-10-13: Private profiles, Hevy style
Owner's call, after looking at how Hevy does it. Replaces "opt-in is the handle":
- **Everyone has a handle and a profile page.** The handle is set at `/welcome` and can be changed but not removed (a trigger refuses setting it back to null).
- **Private profile switch** in `/app/profile` (`profiles.is_private`, default off). A private `/@handle` shows only the handle, name, avatar, bio and link, with "This profile is private" and no stats, calendar, cover photos or entries, and isn't indexed. Enforced in RLS, not just on the page: other people can't read a private profile's entries or trips (even public ones), their trip links or their photos. Per-entry visibility and the default visibility are unchanged, like Hevy's per-workout setting.
- `/app/profile` also edits bio and link, and `/@handle` shows them.
- **Follows later (Phase 3).** Then "private" becomes "approved followers can see it", as in Hevy, via follow requests.

### 2026-10-13: Profile photos
Users add, change or remove a profile photo by tapping the avatar on `/welcome` (optional) or `/app/profile`. It saves on its own as soon as it's picked, separate from the rest of the form. The photo is cropped to the centre square and re-encoded to a 512 px JPEG on the device, which strips EXIF/GPS, then uploaded to a new **public** `avatars` bucket at `{user_id}/{timestamp}.jpg` (migration `20261013150000_avatars.sql`); `profiles.avatar_url` holds its public URL. Public because avatars are public anyway (a private profile still shows its avatar), so no signed URLs. A new file name per upload means caches never show the old photo; the old file is deleted after the profile points at the new one. No in-app cropper yet.
- **Google photo by default.** On first sign-in with Google (no handle and no avatar yet), the auth callback copies the Google profile photo (512 px) into the `avatars` bucket and sets it as the avatar, so `/welcome` starts with it and the user can change or remove it there. Copied rather than linked, so visitors never load images from Google and the avatar doesn't break when the Google photo changes. Only `*.googleusercontent.com` over https is fetched (3 s timeout, JPEG ≤ 2 MB); any failure just skips the photo.

### 2026-10-13: Sign in with Apple on the web
Owner's request. The login page now offers "Continue with Apple" above "Continue with Google", through the same Supabase OAuth flow and `/auth/callback`. Sign-ups stay off, so Apple only signs into an account whose email matches; "Hide My Email" relay addresses won't match, and the error says to choose "Share My Email". Apple shares no profile photo, so only Google sign-ins get a default avatar. The web flow's client secret expires after at most 6 months and must be regenerated (`supabase/README.md`). The iOS app will use native Sign in with Apple (`signInWithIdToken`) against the same provider, which also satisfies App Store rule 4.8.

### 2026-10-13: Basic analytics: Vercel Web Analytics + own `events` table
Owner's call. Page traffic (landing, legal pages, public profiles) goes to **Vercel Web Analytics**: free on Hobby, cookieless (no consent banner), one new dependency (`@vercel/analytics`, approved). Signed-in paths (`/app`, `/login`, `/auth`, `/welcome`) are excluded. Product events go to a write-only Supabase **`events`** table instead of Vercel custom events, which need Vercel Pro; it keeps us at $0 and lets the iOS app record the same events. Two events for now: `entry_logged` (photo or by hand, and how detection did) and `card_shared` (which button, which design). Signed-in users only, so the table can't be spammed anonymously. Anything the database already knows (entries, trips, waitlist `source`) is counted from its own table, not duplicated. No IPs, user agents or free text are stored. Setup and saved queries: `docs/ANALYTICS.md`.

### 2026-10-13: Planned shows are entries with a status, and trips can be derived
Owner's call. A show you're going to see is the same `entries` row as one you've logged, with `status` `planned` → `logged`, not a separate model (migration `20261013210000_planned_entries.sql`). A planned entry needs only a show (title) and a date: `venue_id` is now optional on every entry, and a planned entry can't carry a rating. Logging it later updates the same row, so its trip membership and share links survive. Existing rows and clients default to `logged`. Planned entries are owner-only for now (public RLS reads `logged` entries only), so "I'm going to X" can't leak through a public profile before the owner has decided whether planned shows are shareable. `public_profile_stats` counts logged entries only and no longer drops entries without a venue. In the app, upcoming entries show as a collapsible section at the top of the diary.
- **Not decided yet (trips):** whether trips stay a first-class model (`collections`) or become a view derived from city and date. Nothing about trips changes in this migration.
- **Web reads tolerate a null venue:** the diary, trip, entry, public profile and share-card code show an entry without a venue (no venue stat on the card; editing it asks for a venue on save).
- **Still to do in the apps:** iOS must tolerate a null venue too. (The Upcoming section and planning a show came on 2026-10-14, below.)

### 2026-10-14: Waitlist sign-ups go to Kit, with double opt-in
Owner's call, replacing the Supabase-only waitlist from #10. Kit (kit.com, free plan) sends a confirmation email, so people know they're on the list, and only confirmed addresses count, which filters out junk and bot sign-ups. The honeypot stays. The server action creates the subscriber as inactive and adds them to a double opt-in form (Kit's v4 API, server-side key, no new npm dependency); the sign-up source goes into the referrer URL as `utm_source`. Kit is now the list: the owner imports the existing `waitlist` rows once by CSV. Until `KIT_API_KEY` and `KIT_FORM_ID` are set, sign-ups still go to the `waitlist` table, so none are lost. Trade-off: the list now lives with a third party, but it can be exported from Kit as CSV.

### 2026-10-14: Trips are stored, dated and made by hand; Home · Log · Profile; labels deferred
Owner's call, after discussing derived and hybrid trips. Most visits aren't part of a trip, so trips stay out of the way of logging (migration `20261014120000_trips_v2.sql`).
- **Navigation:** the tabs are **Home · Log · Profile**. Home is the diary for now (a timeline comes later). The Trips tab is gone: trips are listed on Profile, and `/app/trips` redirects there.
- **Trips are stored and made by hand**, not detected. No automatic "make this a trip?" suggestion for v1: any rule for "you're away" needs a home city or past entries to compare against, and new users have neither. Revisit once there's real usage to learn from.
- **Where trips are made:** "+ New trip" on Profile; in the diary, **Select** shows → "Add to a trip" (an existing trip covering all their dates, or a new one with its dates prefilled); and "+ Plan a trip" in the diary's Upcoming header. A trip's page has "Add shows", listing only shows within its dates, all pre-ticked.
- **Log form:** no Trip field by default. It appears only when one of your trips covers the show's date, with that trip pre-selected.
- **Trips have dates:** start and end are both required, and a trip holds only shows dated within them. The database blocks adding a show outside the dates, shrinking the dates past a show, and re-dating a show outside its trip; the user edits the trip's dates first.
- **No trip privacy setting:** a trip is public when it holds a public, logged show (and the profile isn't private); its public view lists only those shows. `collections.visibility` is dropped.
- **Labels are deferred** to a later version. The `label` kind stays in the schema, unused; the app no longer creates or shows labels. No trips or labels existed, so nothing was migrated.
- **Planning a show = giving it a date after today.** The same log form saves it as `planned`, with no rating and an optional venue, into a collapsible **Upcoming** section at the top of the diary. Editing it after the date saves it as logged on the same row. Imported tickets for future dates are saved as planned too. Planned shows don't count in share-card stats, trip stats or the `entry_logged` event.

### 2026-10-14: Trip recap cards on the trip page (#16)
A trip's page opens its share sheet, the same one as an entry (carousel, Stories, More, Download, Copy text), with four trip designs adapted from the "Share cards" canvas (https://claude.ai/artifact/JBrH9jzd4ke4YtpRLQWhPC): **List** and **Photo grid** (dark), **Collage** and **Photos** (light).
- **All square**, owner's call: 1080×1080 with 20-unit rounded corners like the entry cards, and the square trip wrap's header (name; place · dates · N shows) and footer (wordmark, handle) in the same place on every card. An earlier mix of 9:16 Story and 1:1 cards made the carousel change height as you swiped. The canvas's Story layouts (list, grid, collage) are drawn square instead.
- Drawn on the device with Canvas 2D (`apps/web/src/lib/share-card-trip.ts`), like the entry cards, so the system font is used and the photos never go to a server.
- Cards cover the shows seen (logged), in date order; planned shows are left out, as in the trip stats. Without any, there's no share sheet. Stats: number of shows, the city (or "N cities"), theatres visited and the average rating.
- Adapting to the number of shows: the list has photo rows up to 4 shows, compact rows (no thumbnails) up to 6, then 5 rows and "+ N more shows". Grids hold up to 6 tiles, with "+N" on the last. A show without a photo is a tile with its title (initials in the list).
- **Collage layouts per number of shows**, owner's call: the canvas's "Trip collage" row has a hand-placed square layout for each of 2 to 8 shows (polaroid positions, sizes and tilts), copied as is. One show gets a single large polaroid; past 8 the 8-show layout is used, preferring shows with photos, with "+N" on the last polaroid. Title tiles put the title at the top there, since the next row of polaroids overlaps the bottom.
- No "Background" (transparent) toggle for trip cards: each design is built around its ground or photos.
- Analytics: `card_shared` records the design id (`trip-list`, `trip-grid`, `trip-collage`, `trip-square`).

### 2026-10-14: Account deletion
The Profile tab ends with "Delete account". A modal asks the user to type their handle before the delete button enables; Postgres checks the handle again (`delete_my_account`), so iOS gets the same rule. Deletion is immediate and permanent, with no grace period. Entry photos and avatars are removed through the Storage API first, then the auth user is deleted, which cascades to profile, entries, trips and events. Shows and venues the user added stay in the shared catalogue, unattributed.
